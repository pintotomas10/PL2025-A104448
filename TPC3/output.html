<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<b>We broke up a month ago</b>  
Your friends are mine, you know, I know  
You've moved on, found someone new  
One more girl who brings out <i>the better in you</i>  
And I thought my heart was detached  
From all the sunlight of our past  
But she's so <b>sweet</b>, she's so <b>pretty</b>  
Does she mean you forgot about me?  

<h3>Chorus</h3>
Oh, <b>I hope you're happy</b>  
But not like how you were with me  
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go  
So find someone great, but <i>don't find no one better</i>  
I hope you're <i>happy</i>, but <b>don't be happier</b>  

<h3>Verse 2</h3>
And do you tell her she's the <i>most beautiful</i> girl you've ever seen?  
An <b>eternal love</b> bullshit you know you'll never mean  
Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?  
And now I'm pickin' her apart  
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my <i>wretched heart</i>  
But <b>she's beautiful, she looks kind</b>  
She probably gives you <i>butterflies</i>  

<h3>Chorus</h3>
I hope you're <i>happy</i>  
But not like how you were with me  
I'm <i>selfish</i>, I know, I can't let you go  
So find someone great but don't find <b>no one better</b>
I hope you're happy
I wish you <i>all the best</i>, really  
Say <b>you love her</b>, baby, just not like you loved me  
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be <b>happier</b> 

<h2>Bridge</h2>
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

<h3>Chorus</h3>
I <b>hope you're happy</b>  
Just not like how you were with me  
I'm <i>selfish</i>, I know, can't let you go  
So find someone great, but <i>don't find no one better</i>  
I hope you're happy, <b>but don't be happier</b>
