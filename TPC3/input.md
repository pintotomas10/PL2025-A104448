### Verse 1
**We broke up a month ago**  
Your friends are mine, you know, I know  
You've moved on, found someone new  
One more girl who brings out *the better in you*  
And I thought my heart was detached  
From all the sunlight of our past  
But she's so **sweet**, she's so **pretty**  
Does she mean you forgot about me?  

### Chorus
Oh, **I hope you're happy**  
But not like how you were with me  
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go  
So find someone great, but *don't find no one better*  
I hope you're *happy*, but **don't be happier**  

### Verse 2
And do you tell her she's the *most beautiful* girl you've ever seen?  
An **eternal love** bullshit you know you'll never mean  
Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?  
And now I'm pickin' her apart  
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my *wretched heart*  
But **she's beautiful, she looks kind**  
She probably gives you *butterflies*  

### Chorus
I hope you're *happy*  
But not like how you were with me  
I'm *selfish*, I know, I can't let you go  
So find someone great but don't find **no one better**
I hope you're happy
I wish you *all the best*, really  
Say **you love her**, baby, just not like you loved me  
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be **happier** 

## Bridge
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

### Chorus
I **hope you're happy**  
Just not like how you were with me  
I'm *selfish*, I know, can't let you go  
So find someone great, but *don't find no one better*  
I hope you're happy, **but don't be happier**
